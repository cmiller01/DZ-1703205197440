In his book _Notes on the synthesis of form_, Christopher Alexander describes a thought experiment to illustrate how a system might achieve a state of equilibrium.
The system consists of a 100 lightbulbs. Each bulb has two possible states, on and off, and a 50-50 chance of changing state in the next second. The experiment follows on to describe a few different scenarios in which the bulbs might change state:

1. “Connections between lights are constructed so that any light which is off has a 50-50 chance of going on again in the next second, provided at least one of the lights it is connected to is on. If the lights it is directly connected to are off, for the time being it has no chance of going on again, and stays off.”

2. "On the one hand, suppose there are no interconnections between lights at all. In this case there is nothing to prevent each light’s staying off for good, as soon as it goes off. The average time it takes for all the lights to go off is therefore only a little greater than the average time it takes for a single light to go off […]."

3. "On the other hand, imagine such rich interconnections between lights that any one light still on quickly rouses all others from the off state and puts them on again. The only way in which this system can reach adaptation is by the pure chance that all 100 happen to go off at the same moment. The average time which must elapse before this happens will be of the order of 2100 seconds, or 1022 years."
